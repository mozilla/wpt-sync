# wpt-sync

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/wpt-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/wpt-sync)

## Description

Synchronize changes between gecko and web-platform-tests

## Additional documentation

See `./docs`

## Development environment

Setting up a development environment
requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

We're _somewhat_ following [mozilla-services' Dockerflow](https://github.com/mozilla-services/Dockerflow).

If you are on MacOS and have brew installed you can do

```
brew cask install docker
```

### Prerequisites

Depending on what command you want to run, (e.g. wptsync listen), you
may need to provide custom configration files at docker run-time by
placing them in locations that are bind-mounted to the container and
setting container environment variables. See `Dockerfile.dev` and
`start_wptsync.sh`

You can include these customizations in a shell script or a docker-compose.yml:

*   There's a dev-env convenience script for building the docker image and
    running the wptsync command in a corresponding container: `./bin/
    run_docker_dev.sh`. It is similar to the script we use in production.

### Quick Setup

The following setup assumes you have already installed Docker and have it running.
See Development Environment above.

```
./bin/run_docker_dev.sh build
```
This will setup the container and make sure the relevant configuration files are in the right place.
You will be asked to enter in a passphrase when it creates development ssh keys, press enter
to leave these blank.

To run tests do the following

```
./bin/run_docker_dev.sh test
```

### Configuration

Development configuration files are checked in to `config/` and
`config/dev`. `config/dev/ssh` contains (usually non-functional) ssh keys
and is not checked in to the repository.

For production, configuration goes in `config/prod`, following the
layout of `config/dev`. This is never committed to the repository. See
`docs/deployment.md` for more information.

### Raw docker commands

From repo root:

To build an image called `wptsync_dev` with the repo root as the build context:

```
docker build -t wptsync_dev --add-host=rabbitmq:127.0.0.1 --file wpt-sync/docker/Dockerfile.dev .
```


To start all the services in the container:

```
exec docker run -it --add-host=rabbitmq:127.0.0.1 \
  --env WPTSYNC_CONFIG=${WPTSYNC_CONFIG:-/app/config/dev/sync.ini} \
  --env WPTSYNC_CREDS=${WPTSYNC_CREDS:-/app/config/dev/credentials.ini} \
  --env WPTSYNC_GECKO_CONFIG=${WPTSYNC_GECKO_CONFIG:/app/config/gecko_config} \
  --env WPTSYNC_WPT_CONFIG=${WPTSYNC_WPT_CONFIG:/app/config/wpt_config} \
  --env WPTSYNC_GH_SSH_KEY=${WPTSYNC_GH_SSH_KEY:/app/config/dev/ssh/id_github} \
  --env WPTSYNC_HGMO_SSH_KEY=${WPTSYNC_HGMO_SSH_KEY:/app/config/dev/ssh/id_hgmo} \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/config,target=/app/config \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/sync,target=/app/wpt-sync/sync \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/test,target=/app/wpt-sync/test \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/repos,target=/app/repos \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/workspace,target=/app/workspace \
  wptsync_dev
```

This runs the script designated by ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile with an `init`process. You could use `--env-file` instead of `--env` to set environment variables in the container.

Stop it with:

```
docker stop [container name]
```

You can see names of running containers with `docker container ls`.

If you want to run a different command in the container
interactively, use the `-it` and `--entrypoint` options like:


```
docker run -it --env WPTSYNC_REPO_ROOT=/app/wpt-sync/test/testdata \
    --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/app/wpt-sync \
    --entrypoint "some_command" wptsync_dev
```

You can pass additional flags to the entrypoint after the `wptsync_dev` part, like `... --entrypoint "some_command" wptsync_dev -x`

### Volumes to --mount

See the VOLUMES directive in the Dockerfile for information about what
volumes it's expecting.

### Permissions

Inside the Docker container we run as the app user with uid 10001. This user
requires write permissions to directories `repos`, `workspace`, and
`config/dev/ssh`.

If you're on Linux, for each path run

```
sudo chown -R 10001 <path>
```

You may not need to do this at all on mac.

__Note__ that replacing the default entry point means that you're no longer running the `start_wptsync.sh` script at container start-up and therefore some
configuration may be missing or incomplete. For example, the Dockerfile (build-time) doesn't set up any credentials; instead, credentials are only set up in the container at run-time with the above-mentioned script.
