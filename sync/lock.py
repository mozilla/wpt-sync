"""
Locking system for the wpt sync.

There are two principal kinds of lock defined here; the RepoLock that's
used to protect against concurrent writes to the underlying storage, and
the SyncLock, which is used to ensure that multiples processes don't try
to update the same sync at the same time.

Since the sync is run from multiple processes without shared memory,
and each process is single threaded, the locks must be based on files.

A RepoLock is pretty straightforward; only one process is allowed to
acquire the RepoLock at a time. Like all locks it's intended to be used
as a context manager, and there's a repo_lock decoration for functions
and methods that must acquire the lock for their entire body.

For the SyncLock, things are more complex. Processes are put into the
following groups:
* All upstream syncs
* All landing syncs
* Downstream syncs for each pr

Within each group operations that update data must be sequenced i.e.
there is a lock that must be obtained for each group when writing.
That lock is represented by the SyncLock object and it has an
associated "subtype" which is the kind of sync (upstream, downstream,
or landing) and object id which is the PR id for downstream syncs
or None otherwise.

In order to allow for read-only access to sync objects and to ensure
that we don't have data races, functions and methods that cause mutation
to the underlying data are annotated with the @mut() decorator. When
applied to a class method this does the following

* Ensures that the instance has a property called _lock
* Ensures that the _lock property is a acquired SyncLock with the
  right attributes for mutation of this class.

In order to set the properties, classes with mutable state must provide
an as_mut() method that takes the current lock as an argument. This returns
a context manager object that ensures mutation methods are accessible for
the defined context. This is clearer with an example:

# Ensure we have the lock for upstream syns
with SyncLock("upstream", None) as lock:
   sync = UpstreamSync.for_bug(git_gecko, git_wpt, bug)

   # Reading the sync is possible here
   print sync.status

   # But writing will fail unless we are in a mut block
   with sync.as_mut(lock):
       sync.update_wpt_commits()

The @mut decorator can also be used on functions to check that arguments
passed into those functions are available for mutation; in this case the
decorator takes the names of the arguments to check e.g.

@mut("sync")
def some_update_fn(git_gecko, git_wpt, sync):
    # Sync must be mutable here or we would fail
    sync.update_wpt_commits()

Constructing new objects is also a form of mutation, but because an object
doesn't exist yet a slightly different approach is required. The
@constructor decorator marks a classmethod that creates new instances and
can only be called with an appropriate lock. But in this case the lock is
passed as the first argument to the function, and the lock checking is done
by providing a function argument to the decorator that takes the arguments
to the constructor and returns a (subtype, obj_id) pair used to check for
lock validity e.g.

@classmethod
@constructor(lambda kwargs: (kwargs["process_name"].subtype,
                             kwargs["process_name"].obj_id))
def create(cls, lock, git_gecko, git_wpt, process_name):
    pass

All objects that can cause mutation of the underlying sync data must
implement this locking system. In order to do so, the object must
provide the following methods and properties:

property _lock - None or a SyncLock representing the currenly held lock
method lock_key - Returns the (subtype, obj_id) pair for the current
                  instance, used to ensure the lock is valid
method as_mut - Used to make the object mutable. Returns a MutGuard
                wrapping the current object.
